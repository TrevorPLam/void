# AI/LLM Security Review Workflow

This workflow provides a comprehensive security review process for AI and LLM integrations, ensuring compliance with OWASP GenAI security standards.

## Step 1: Input Security Assessment
Evaluate how user inputs are handled before reaching AI models:

1. **Input Validation**
   - Check for proper schema validation using Zod or similar
   - Verify input sanitization and encoding
   - Ensure length limits and character restrictions
   - Validate file uploads and content types

2. **Prompt Injection Prevention**
   - Review prompt templating and escaping mechanisms
   - Check for instruction following techniques
   - Verify user input separation from system prompts
   - Test for prompt injection attempts

## Step 2: Model Security Review
Assess the security of AI model interactions:

1. **API Security**
   - Verify API key storage and rotation
   - Check for proper authentication headers
   - Review rate limiting implementation
   - Validate request signing and verification

2. **Output Validation**
   - Check for content filtering and sanitization
   - Verify output schema validation
   - Review harmful content detection
   - Ensure no sensitive data leakage

## Step 3: Data Privacy Compliance
Ensure compliance with privacy regulations:

1. **Data Handling**
   - Review data retention policies
   - Check for PII detection and redaction
   - Verify consent management
   - Assess data residency requirements

2. **Third-party Services**
   - Review data sharing with AI providers
   - Check for privacy policy compliance
   - Verify data processing agreements
   - Assess cross-border data transfers

## Step 4: Operational Security
Review operational aspects of AI deployments:

1. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Check for comprehensive audit trails
   - Review anomaly detection mechanisms
   - Verify cost monitoring and alerts
   - Assess performance monitoring

2. **Incident Response**
   - Review AI-specific incident procedures
   - Check for model failure fallbacks
   - Verify containment strategies
   - Assess communication protocols

## Step 5: Testing and Validation
Comprehensive testing of AI security measures:

1. **Security Testing**
   - Perform prompt injection testing
   - Test for data leakage scenarios
   - Verify rate limiting effectiveness
   - Test authentication bypass attempts

2. **Adversarial Testing**
   - Test with malicious inputs
   - Verify model behavior under stress
   - Check for prompt jailbreaking
   - Test for model hallucination impacts

## Security Checklist

### Input Security

- [ ] Prompt injection defenses implemented
- [ ] Input sanitization and encoding in place
- [ ] File upload security configured

### Model Security
- [ ] API keys properly secured and rotated
- [ ] Output validation and filtering active
- [ ] Rate limiting and cost controls configured
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose secrets

### Data Privacy
- [ ] PII detection and redaction implemented
- [ ] Consent management configured
- [ ] Data retention policies enforced
- [ ] Cross-border data compliance verified

### Operational Security
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging active
- [ ] Anomaly detection configured
- [ ] Cost monitoring and alerts set
- [ ] Incident response procedures defined

### Testing
- [ ] Security testing completed
- [ ] Adversarial testing performed
- [ ] Penetration testing conducted
- [ ] Regular security reviews scheduled

## Critical Security Issues (Stop Deployment)

- **No prompt injection protection** - Immediate security risk
- **API keys in client code** - Credential exposure
- **No output validation** - Content security risk
- **Missing audit logging** - Compliance and security risk
- **No rate limiting** - Cost and DoS risk

## Tools and Commands

### Security Testing
```bash
# Prompt injection testing
npm run test:prompt-injection

# API security scanning
npm run audit:api

# Dependency vulnerability check
npm audit --audit-level moderate

# SBOM generation
npm run sbom
```

### Monitoring Setup
```bash
# AI-specific monitoring
npm install @opentelemetry/api-ai

# Cost tracking
npm install ai-cost-monitor

# Anomaly detection
npm install anomaly-detector
```

## Documentation Requirements

1. **AI Security Policy** - Document all security measures
2. **Data Processing Agreement** - For third-party AI services
3. **Incident Response Plan** - AI-specific procedures
4. **Compliance Documentation** - Privacy and regulatory compliance

## Review Frequency

- **Pre-deployment**: Full security review
- **Quarterly**: Security assessment update
- **After incidents**: Post-mortem and improvements
- **Model updates**: Security impact assessment

Remember: AI security is an ongoing process, not a one-time checklist. Regular reviews and updates are essential as threats evolve.
