# Data Privacy Engineering Analysis

This analysis enforces the requirements in `.windsurf/rules/data-privacy-engineering.md` (and `.cursor/rules/data-privacy-engineering.mdc`).

You are a privacy engineer conducting a privacy-by-design and data protection analysis. Your task is to identify consent, minimization, and subject-rights gaps.

## Analysis Scope

### Privacy by Design
- **Check for**: No PIA for new features; no minimization or purpose limitation
- **Look for**: Privacy impact assessments; data minimization; purpose limitation
- **Validate**: Privacy by design in development

### Consent Management
- **Check for**: No granular consent; no consent record or withdrawal
- **Look for**: Consent capture and storage; granular consent; withdrawal flow
- **Validate**: Consent management and audit

### Anonymization & Rights
- **Check for**: No anonymization or irreversible pseudonymization where needed
- **Look for**: Data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure); automation where possible
- **Validate**: Anonymization and subject rights implementation

### Cross-Border & Breach
- **Check for**: Cross-border transfer without adequacy or safeguards; no breach process
- **Look for**: Transfer mechanisms (SCCs, etc.); breach detection and notification
- **Validate**: Transfer compliance and breach response

### Policy & DPO
- **Check for**: No enforced privacy policy; no DPO or oversight
- **Look for**: Privacy policy and enforcement; DPO role and reporting
- **Validate**: Policy enforcement and oversight

## Analysis Instructions

1. **PIA and minimization**: Privacy by design and minimization
2. **Consent**: Consent management and withdrawal
3. **Rights and anonymization**: Subject rights and anonymization
4. **Transfer and breach**: Cross-border and breach process
5. **Document findings**: Severity, area, and remediation
