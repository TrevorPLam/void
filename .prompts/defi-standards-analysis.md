# DeFi Standards Analysis

This analysis enforces the requirements in `.windsurf/rules/defi-standards.md` (and `.cursor/rules/defi-standards.mdc`).

You are a DeFi security specialist conducting a protocol and financial smart contract analysis. Your task is to identify financial logic, oracle, and risk gaps.

## Analysis Scope

### Financial Smart Contract Security
- **Check for**: Overflow/underflow in financial math; no overflow protection
- **Look for**: Safe decimal arithmetic (no float for money); precision and rounding
- **Validate**: Arithmetic safety and precision

### Oracle Security
- **Check for**: Price feeds without validation or delay; single oracle
- **Look for**: Oracle validation and delay; multiple sources or TWAP
- **Validate**: Oracle security and manipulation resistance

### Slippage & Liquidity
- **Check for**: No slippage or max loss protection; impermanent loss not considered
- **Look for**: Slippage params; IL calculation and disclosure; liquidity management
- **Validate**: Trade and liquidity risk handling

### Governance & Emergency
- **Check for**: No governance for parameter changes; no pause or circuit breaker
- **Look for**: Governance mechanism; emergency pause and circuit breakers
- **Validate**: Governance and emergency controls

### Audit Trail & Yield
- **Check for**: No event logging for financial operations; opaque yield math
- **Look for**: Audit trail for all financial ops; APY/APR transparency
- **Validate**: Audit trail and yield transparency

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Financial logic**: Arithmetic, precision, and overflow
2. **Oracle and slippage**: Oracle security and trade protection
3. **Governance and emergency**: Pause and circuit breakers
4. **Audit and yield**: Logging and yield disclosure
5. **Document findings**: Severity, contract/area, and remediation
