# MLOps Standards Analysis

This analysis enforces the requirements in `.windsurf/rules/mlops-standards.md` (and `.cursor/rules/mlops-standards.mdc`).

You are an MLOps specialist conducting a production ML and model lifecycle analysis. Your task is to identify versioning, monitoring, and deployment gaps.

## Analysis Scope

### Model Versioning & Registry
- **Check for**: No model registry or versioning; unreproducible models
- **Look for**: Model registry (MLflow, etc.); version and lineage
- **Validate**: Versioned models and registry

### Data & Feature Pipelines
- **Check for**: No data validation or feature store; inconsistent features
- **Look for**: Feature store and validation; preprocessing pipelines
- **Validate**: Data and feature pipeline quality

### Drift & Monitoring
- **Check for**: No data or model drift detection; no performance monitoring
- **Look for**: Drift detection and alerting; performance metrics over time
- **Validate**: Drift and performance monitoring

### A/B & Canary
- **Check for**: No A/B or canary for model rollout; big-bang deploy
- **Look for**: Canary or shadow mode; rollback on degradation
- **Validate**: Safe model rollout

### Explainability & Compliance
- **Check for**: No explainability for high-stakes models; no bias monitoring
- **Look for**: SHAP/LIME or equivalent; bias and fairness checks
- **Validate**: Explainability and compliance

### Serving & Recovery
- **Check for**: No autoscaling or load balancing for inference; no rollback
- **Look for**: Serving infrastructure; rollback and recovery procedure
- **Validate**: Serving and recovery

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Registry and versioning**: Model registry and reproducibility
2. **Data and features**: Validation and feature store
3. **Monitoring**: Drift and performance
4. **Rollout and serving**: A/B, canary, serving, rollback
5. **Document findings**: Severity, component, and remediation
