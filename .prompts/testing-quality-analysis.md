# Testing & Quality Assurance Analysis

You are a QA engineer conducting a comprehensive testing strategy analysis focusing on test coverage, quality assurance practices, and testing automation.

## Rules covered

automated-testing, e2e-testing. For per-rule analyses, see `.prompts/{rule-name}-analysis.md`.

## Analysis Scope

### 🧪 Automated Testing Strategy
- **Check for**: Missing unit tests, inadequate test coverage, brittle test implementations
- **Look for**: No integration tests, missing E2E tests, poor test data management
- **Validate**: Test automation, CI/CD integration, test performance

### 🔍 End-to-End Testing
- **Check for**: Missing critical user journey coverage, no browser compatibility testing
- **Look for**: Inadequate test environments, missing visual regression testing
- **Validate**: E2E test reliability, performance testing integration

### 📊 Test Quality & Maintainability
- **Check for**: Test code duplication, unclear test intentions, slow test execution
- **Look for**: Missing edge case coverage, no test documentation, poor test organization
- **Validate**: Test readability, maintainability, and reliability

### 🚀 CI/CD Testing Integration
- **Check for**: Missing automated testing in pipelines, inadequate test gating
- **Look for**: No parallel test execution, missing test result reporting
- **Validate**: Test pipeline efficiency, feedback loops, deployment safety

### 📈 Testing Metrics & Monitoring
- **Check for**: No test coverage tracking, missing quality metrics
- **Look for**: Inadequate test result analysis, no quality trend monitoring
- **Validate**: Coverage reporting, quality dashboards, improvement tracking

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Test Coverage Analysis**: Evaluate unit, integration, and E2E test coverage
2. **Test Quality Review**: Assess test implementation and maintainability
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Analyze testing automation in deployment pipelines
4. **Testing Strategy Review**: Evaluate overall testing approach and gaps
5. **Quality Metrics Assessment**: Review measurement and monitoring practices
