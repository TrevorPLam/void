# Infrastructure: Background Jobs & Concurrency

<audit_rules>
- You MUST verify that background jobs are processed asynchronously via a durable queue (e.g., Redis/BullMQ), NEVER using synchronous `setTimeout` or blocking request threads.
- You MUST ensure every job has robust retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures.
- You MUST implement a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for jobs that fail consistently after maximum retries.
- You MUST verify idempotency keys are used for critical operations (e.g., payment processing) to prevent duplicate execution during retries.
- You MUST ensure webhook endpoints acknowledge receipt immediately (HTTP 200) and offload the actual processing to a background job.
- You MUST enforce concurrency controls to respect third-party API rate limits (e.g., Resend, Stripe) when processing batches.
</audit_rules>

<example_good>
```typescript
// Webhook handler offloading to a queue
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const payload = await req.json();
  const signature = req.headers.get('stripe-signature');
  
  // Verify signature and push to queue, return 200 immediately
  await paymentQueue.add('process-webhook', payload, {
    jobId: payload.id, // Idempotency key
    attempts: 3,
    backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 1000 }
  });
  
  return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
}
```
</example_good>

<example_bad>
```typescript
// BAD: Processing webhook synchronously and blocking
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const payload = await req.json();
  
  // If this takes >10s, Stripe will timeout and retry, causing duplicates
  await processHeavyDatabaseOperation(payload);
  await sendWelcomeEmail(payload);
  
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}
```
