# Infrastructure: Service Mesh & Traffic Management Standards

<audit_rules>
- You MUST implement proper service mesh configuration for traffic management and security.
- You MUST configure mTLS (mutual TLS) for all inter-service communication.
- You MUST implement traffic splitting and canary deployments for safe rollouts.
- You MUST configure circuit breaking and outlier detection for resilience.
- You MUST implement proper observability with distributed tracing and metrics collection.
- You MUST configure retry policies and timeouts for service communication.
- You MUST implement proper access control with service-to-service authentication.
- You MUST ensure proper ingress/egress gateway configuration for edge traffic.
- You MUST configure health checks and readiness probes for service mesh endpoints.
- You MUST implement proper traffic mirroring for testing and debugging.
</audit_rules>
